# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

#### Overview

This project is done using Express, Mongoose, and Validator. I hope to eventually implement React into this project too. 

##### Description of tech stack 

This project is broken down into several different modules starting with the main directories including controllers, models, routes, and utils. This includes an app.js in the root directory that is the central file used to run the program.

###### Project Pitch

I am unable to download the video and post to my google drive as it is only on the premium account that it will let me download it, so here is a direct link to my loom account.
